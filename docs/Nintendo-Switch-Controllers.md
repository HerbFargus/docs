## Installation

First, you need to install [dkms-hid-nintendo](https://github.com/nicman23/dkms-hid-nintendo), a Nintendo HID kernel module:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nicman23/dkms-hid-nintendo
cd dkms-hid-nintendo
sudo dkms add .
sudo dkms build nintendo -v 3.1
sudo dkms install nintendo -v 3.1
```

Then, you need [joycond](https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond), a userspace driver which manages the controllers and exposes their motion inputs.

On a fresh install, you might need to install the libevdev library first:

```shell
sudo apt-get install libevdev-dev
```

Then install the joycond itself:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/DanielOgorchock/joycond.git
cd joycond
cmake .
sudo make install
sudo systemctl enable --now joycond
```
## Usage

Just like in a Nintendo Switch, after you connect it to Retropie through Bluetooth in the Retropie Menu (press the button next to the USB-C port to put the controller in pairing mode), you'll need to press triggers to select the position. After you press any button and the player indicator lights start blinking, do the following:

|Position/Controller|Buttons to press|
|--|--|
| One Joycon, Horizontal |Press **SR+SL**  |
|One Joycon, Vertical |Press **L and ZL** or **R and ZR**  |
|Two Joycons/Pro Controller |Press **L or ZL** and **R or ZR**  |
